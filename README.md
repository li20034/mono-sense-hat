# mono-sense-hat
Source code for Sense HAT Mono .NET library

## Description
This library is designed to be used for interaction with the Sense HAT in .NET languages. We recommend using the library with Raspbian as we haven't been able to test with any other distributions.

## Installation
  1. Clone/Download the repository
  2. Navigate to the LowLevelWrappers directory
  3. Run install.sh as root
  4. Navigate to the SenseHat directory
  5. Run build.sh
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/li20034/mono-sense-hat
$ cd mono-sense-hat/LowLevelWrappers
$ sudo ./install.sh
$ cd ../SenseHat
$ ./build.sh
```

## Usage
The .dll file that is generated by build.sh can be added as a reference in .NET projects. Full documentation of the library is not available at this time, however the source code is thoroughly commented.
